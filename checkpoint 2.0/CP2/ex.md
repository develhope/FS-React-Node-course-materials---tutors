Task 1: Student Data Manipulation

Starting from an array of student objects
let students = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 20, grades: [85, 92, 88] },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 22, grades: [70, 80, 75] },
    { name: 'Charlie', age: 23, grades: [95, 90, 93] },
    { name: 'David', age: 21, grades: [60, 65, 70] },
    { name: 'Eve', age: 20, grades: [78, 82, 85] }
];
Step 1: Use a for loop to print each student's name and age.
Step 2: Use forEach to print each student's name and average grade.
Step 3: Use filter to create an array of students older than 21.
Step 4: Use push to add a new student to the array.
Step 5: Use pop to remove the last student from the array.
Step 6: Use unshift to add a new student to the beginning of the array.
Step 7: Use shift to remove the first student from the array.
Step 8: Use join to create a string of student names separated by commas.
Step 9: Define a function expression to check if a student's average grade is greater than 80.
Step 10: Use filter with the function expression to create an array of students with high average grades.
Step 11: Define a callback function to print student details.
Step 12: Use forEach with the callback function to print details of all students.
Step 13: Use an arrow function inside forEach to print if each student is "Pass" or "Fail" based on their average grade.
